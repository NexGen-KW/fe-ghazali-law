biography: |
  Khadija is a highly respected legal consultant with almost two decades of experience advising clients throughout Lebanon, Kuwait, and the wider GCC. As a key member of the International Department at Rawan Mishari Al Ghazali Law Firm, she handles complex cross-border matters in commercial, corporate, administrative, and international law, drawing on deep knowledge of both civil- and common-law systems.

  Over her career, Khadija has guided multinational companies, NGOs, and government-linked entities on energy transactions, regulatory compliance, employment issues, and legal-policy initiatives. Fluent in Arabic and English, she drafts, negotiates, and interprets intricate legal documents with linguistic precision and cultural sensitivity, and she frequently supports corporate-governance and public-sector-reform projects across the MENA region.

  An active scholar and commentator, Khadija publishes research on oil-and-gas law—especially the governance of petroleum resources—and contributes opinion pieces on legal reform, energy law, and gender equity to leading Arabic newspapers. While pursuing a Ph.D. in International Law focused on petroleum-resource regimes, she also lectures on petroleum law for professionals in the energy and legal sectors. Her blend of academic rigor, practical cross-border insight, and bilingual expertise makes her a trusted advisor on high-stakes energy, administrative, and commercial matters at both regional and international levels.
